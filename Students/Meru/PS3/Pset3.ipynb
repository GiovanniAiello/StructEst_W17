    "You can observe time series data in an economy for the following variables $(c_t, k_t, w_t, r_t)$. The first line of this file contains variable labels. These data have 100 periods, which are quarterly (25 years). Suppose you think the data are generated by a pricess similar to the Brock and Mirman (1972). A simplified set of characterizing equations of the Brock and Mirman model are the following:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "c_t^{-1} - \\beta E[r_{t+1}(c_{t+1})^{-1}] & = 0 && \\text{(1)} \\\\\n",
    "c_t - k_{t+1} - w_t - r_t k_t & = 0 && \\text{(2)} \\\\\n",
    "w_t - (1-\\alpha)e^{z_t}k_t^\\alpha & = 0 && \\text{(3)} \\\\\n",
    "r_t - \\alpha e^{z_t} k_t^{\\alpha - 1} & = 0 && \\text{(4)} \\\\\n",

    "The variable $c_t$ is aggregate consumption in period $t$. $k_{t+1}$ is total household savings and investment in period $t$ for which they receive a return in the next period (this model assumes full depreciation of capital). The wage per unit of labor in period $t$ is $w_t$ adn the interest rate or rate of return on investment is $r_t$. Total factor productivity is $z_t$, which follows an AR(1) process. The rest of the symbols in the equations are parameters that must be estimated:\n",
    "$$ (\\alpha, \\beta, \\rho, \\mu, \\sigma) $$\n",
    "The constraints on these parameters are:\n",
    "$$ \\alpha, \\beta \\in (0,1), \\quad \\mu,\\sigma > 0, \\quad \\rho \\in (-1,1) $$\n",
